<h1> Travelling by Road </h1>
<p> We can reach out to our desired place travelling by road. Travel by road is a litle bit difficult but when we have to go and have to cover a small distance then by air is not suitable for us so for that reason travel by road method use and from centuries people are travelling through roads.

<h1> Travelling by water </h1>
<p> We can also travel by using water routes. Whenever we need to transfer a heavyload then we have only one option for travelling and this is travel by air. when different countries import something from another country or organization then we use ships. These ships travel throughout the water and takes usally more time then normal. But heavyload such as imported cars and heavy machinery can be transfer only on ships. Therefore, its an important way of travelling. Moreover in lakes people sit on the boats and enjoy the journey in water. This way of travelling is much dangerous as sea layers may harm to ship.Some water vehicles names are mentioned below as :</p>
